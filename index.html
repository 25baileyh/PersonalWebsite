    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>I am a 9th grader at Sunset Jr. High. My favorite subject is English. My least favorite subject is Math. I am most excited for High School to be able to take more classes and find what I like to do and what I want to go to collage for.</p>
    <p>I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters. I also have a golden doodle his name is Bayou. I love to play Volleyball and Basketball. This year I played volleyball at Clearfield High School and I had so much fun. I play basketball at Sunset Jr. High. I love to play both sports but I think that I like playing Volleball best. I am hoping to get a scolarship to play volleyball in collage. Me and my family just sold our house so we are living with my Meemaw in Roy Utah right now.  </p>
